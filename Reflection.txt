REFLECTION ON LAB ASSIGNMENT ONE
The first lab assignment in the course Object Oriented programming is in my vision a good starting point as it 
introduced student to simple c++ language. in the assignment i have learned about how to use scanf and printf. i had took introduction 
to programiing in c++ 5 years ago. so, most of the question in the lab assignment were helpfull in making me remeber the language
.The most difficult task for me was understadning the error massages and using them to correct bugs in my code. i have tried to goodle
the errors to understand what i did wrong in the code. overall the lab was good introduction. However i would like if the a discussion form is created for students to
discuss the assigmnets. i have seen no discussion on canvas, therefore, students may be not familier with canvas discussion forum.
overall, i like the task and i approxiamelty took me 5 Hours to complete.
